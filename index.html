<h1>Welcome to Chirp</h1>
<p>
    Chirp â€“ the app that finally lets you capture those brilliant thoughts that pop into your head right before falling asleep... and that you'd definitely forget by morning.
    Whether it's secret plans for world domination, grocery lists you'll ignore anyway, or philosophical monologues â€“ just hit record, listen back, and marvel at how clever (or cringey) you really are.
    All wrapped in a dead-simple interface that even your grandma could master. ðŸŽ¤ðŸ˜Ž
